This is an election vote casting application where two candidates A and B are contesting for an election.
There are five electorates and each electorate can cast their vote only once for one candidate as either choice "A" or "B".
After casting the vote and receiving the vote message from all other electorates, each electorate should be able to independently determine the winner and display it.
